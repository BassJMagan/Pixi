# Pixi
Python script to get random images from Pixiv and then tag them with Smilingwolf's wd-vit-large-tagger-v3 if you like the result &amp; want to use in anime-based diffusion models.

To use simply:


```pip install gradio huggingface_hub onnxruntime pandas numpy pillow requests```


Then you're good to go, run the script and it'll open a Gradio window in your browser with two simple buttons.
